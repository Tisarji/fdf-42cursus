- `start`: The starting point index in the `convert_matrix`.
- `end`: The ending point index in the `convert_matrix`.

### draw_horizontal

This function draws a horizontal line between two points on the image.

**Parameters:**
- `line`: A pointer to the `t_draw_line` structure containing the image and other drawing parameters.

### draw_line

This function selects the appropriate line drawing function (vertical, horizontal, x-axis, or y-axis) based on the given points and draws the line on the image.

**Parameters:**
- `img`: A pointer to the `mlx_image_t` structure representing the image.
- `convert_matrix`: A 2D array of floats representing the points to be connected.
- `start`: The starting point index in the `convert_matrix`.
- `end`: The ending point index in the `convert_matrix`.

# üßæ¬†Summary

### DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm

- **Calculation Method**: The DDA algorithm calculates the intermediate points of the line by incrementing one coordinate and calculating the corresponding value of the other coordinate using a floating-point addition. It uses the equation of the line y=mx+b to calculate each point.
    
    $y=mx+by = mx + b$
    
- **Steps**:
    - Determine the number of steps required, based on the greater of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates (steps=max(abs(dx),abs(dy))).
        
        $steps=max‚Å°(abs(dx),abs(dy))\text{steps} = \max(\text{abs}(dx), \text{abs}(dy))$
        
    - Calculate the increments in the x and y coordinates for each step (xincrement=stepsdx, yincrement=stepsdy).
        
        $xincrement=dx stepsx_{\text{increment}} = \frac{dx}{\text{steps}}$
        
        $yincrement=dystepsy_{\text{increment}} = \frac{dy}{\text{steps}}$
        
    - Start from the initial point and add the increments to generate subsequent points.
- **Performance**:
    - Requires floating-point arithmetic, which can be slower and less efficient than integer arithmetic.
    - Simple and easy to implement.
- **Accuracy**:
    - Can suffer from rounding errors due to floating-point calculations.

### Bresenham's Line Algorithm

- **Calculation Method**: Bresenham's algorithm uses integer arithmetic to determine the points of the line. It decides the best approximation for the next pixel based on an error term that is incrementally updated.
- **Steps**:
    - Start from the initial point and calculate the differences dx and dy.
        
        dxdx
        
        dydy
        
    - Determine the step directions (signs of increments) based on the start and end points.
    - Initialize the error term $err=dx‚àídy$
        
        $err=dx‚àídy\text{err} = dx - dy$
        
    - For each point, adjust the error term and decide the next pixel based on the error term. If the error exceeds a threshold, adjust the primary and secondary coordinates accordingly.
- **Performance**:
    - Uses only integer arithmetic, making it faster and more efficient than DDA.
    - Optimized for drawing lines with a high degree of accuracy.
- **Accuracy**:
    - Provides exact pixel positions, making it more accurate and less prone to rounding errors.
